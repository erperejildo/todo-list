# todo-list
Todo list with Meteor and AngularJS.

After download or clone this repository run `npm install`.

Commands:
- `run meteor`: starts a server in http://localhost:3000/
- `meteor run android-device`: starts a server in http://localhost:3000/ and in our connected device to our PC (try to add something from mobile and look the desktop view).
- `meteor test --driver-package practicalmeteor:mocha`: runs tests.

You could download IOS platform and run the app in your iPhone (not tested but should be ok) or create new tests.
